 Question 1 .Image Scraping, Filtering & Semantic Search

This project automates image scraping, filtering, and semantic search using deep learning and FAISS. It scrapes images from websites, removes ads based on size, and extracts feature embeddings using a pretrained ResNet-50 model. The extracted features are indexed with FAISS, enabling fast semantic search to find visually similar images. Built with Python, PyTorch, FAISS, and NumPy, it is useful for e-commerce, content-based image retrieval, and automated web scraping. Future improvements include CNN-based ad filtering and advanced feature extraction models.
